# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project aims to predict employee attrition using various regression models. The dataset includes employee information, survey data, and in/out time records. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

The required Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using:
```sh
pip install -r
```

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing script DataPreprocessing.py performs the following steps:

1. Load datasets from the DataSets/ directory.
2. Remove leading/trailing whitespaces from values and column names.
3. Replace 'NA' values with np.nan.
4. Merge datasets on EmployeeID.
5. Keep only the required columns.
6. Remove rows with missing data.
7. Identify numerical and non-numerical columns.
8. Normalize non-numerical columns.
9. Calculate average hours worked per day for each employee.
10. Normalize numerical columns.
11. Save the preprocessed data to GeneratedDataSet/ModelDataSet.csv.

## Model Training and Evaluation

The LinearRegression.py script performs the following steps:

1. Load the preprocessed data from GeneratedDataSet/ModelDataSet.csv.
2. Split the data into training and test sets.
3. Define parameter grids for various regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet).
4. Run grid search to find the best model and parameters.
5. Evaluate the best model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
6. Save the regression coefficients to regression_coefficients.csv.
7. Visualize the predictions vs. actual values
